### Where can I test the application without compiling?

### G-tests
It utilises google tests, they can be found in `src/gtests`. It is currently not integrated with anything, just works standalone when loading in the project in an IDE.
You're able to run the google tests by selecting gtest.exe as executable that you wish to build in the IDE of your choice.
